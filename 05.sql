    --------- EXPLICACIÃ“N PER MUA -------------
    -- ROW_NUMBER gives a number to each row within the result, this is what will let us choose the first number when requested. It ALWAYS goes with OVER which defines the end of numeration.
    -- PARTITION BY means we are going to group the data by calls_ivr_id, this ensures that an independent numbering is generated for each id, meaning each group of records with the SAME id will have its own sequence of numbers
    -- CASE WHEN ... it's the condition, if the value is UNKNOWN gives value 0 if not, 1 and we set it in DESC order so it shows 1 first. 
    -- RN we only take the first value of each group of calls_ivr_id
